origin/master - origin is the source/remote repo, present on github, origin/master tells us where is master on that repo.
hence it tells us where is master branch in origin. (Remote tracking branch)

git remote # Shows list of remote repositories
git remote -v # Shows verbose ie more details about the remote repository

git pull # Fetch + merge
git push origin main # Pushes main to origin
git push -u origin main # the -u (or --set-upstream) option is used to set the default remote branch for the current local branch.
It means that in the future, when you use git pull or git push without specifying a branch, Git knows which remote branch to pull from or push to.
